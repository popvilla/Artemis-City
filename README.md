# Agentic Codex: Version Zero

## 1. Brief Description
The Agentic Codex is an architectural framework designed to align agentic reasoning with transparent, accountable action across distributed intelligence systemsâ€”both human and machine. This initial scaffolding, Version Zero, provides a foundational structure for defining agents, managing memory, establishing interfaces, and simulating environments, all seeded with the intention of iterative clarity and accountable collaboration. It balances trust, entropy, and collaboration, moving towards a "net good over noise" ethos.

## 2. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
*   **Python 3.8 or higher**: The core CLI and simulation scripts are written in Python.
*   **pip**: Python's package installer, usually comes with Python.

## 3. Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to get the Agentic Codex running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable, otherwise download the files):
    ```bash
    # If this were a git repository
    # git clone <your-repository-url>
    # cd agentic-codex
    ```
    For this generated project, simply ensure all files are in a directory named `agentic-codex`.

2.  **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd agentic-codex
    ```

3.  **Create a Python virtual environment** (recommended for dependency management):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    *   **On macOS and Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows**:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

5.  **Install project dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 4. Running the Application
Once the setup is complete and your virtual environment is activated, you can run the Agentic Codex CLI:

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active** (if not, follow step 4 from "Setup & Installation").
2.  **Execute the main CLI script**:
    ```bash
    python interface/codex_cli.py
    ```
    This will launch a simple command-line interface for interacting with the Codex.
