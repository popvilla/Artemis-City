# Sandbox City: Semantic Zones Detail

This document provides a more detailed breakdown of the semantic zones within Sandbox City, linking their metaphorical roles to their underlying functional implementations in the Agentic Codex.

## 1. Post Office (Secure Load Zone)
*   **Metaphor**: A place for sending and receiving important, often sensitive, mail.
*   **Function**: Handles secure data transfer and communication. This zone is managed primarily by the `Pack Rat` agent. It involves encryption, decryption, and integrity checks for data packets moving between agents or external systems.
*   **Linked Protocols**: Translator Protocol, specific encryption protocols.
*   **Simulation**: `networked_scripts/mail_delivery_sim.py`

## 2. Town Hall (Governance Hub)
*   **Metaphor**: The seat of local government, where laws are made and enforced.
*   **Function**: The core governance and policy enforcement module. `Artemis` operates here, conducting audits, resolving disputes, and ensuring adherence to the `Codex Manifesto`.
*   **Linked Protocols**: Codex Manifesto, Memory Lawyer Protocol (for dispute logs).
*   **Monitoring**: `networked_scripts/system_health_check.sh` (for critical governance systems).

## 3. Library (Memory Archives)
*   **Metaphor**: A vast repository of knowledge, where information is stored, cataloged, and retrieved.
*   **Function**: The primary interface to the `Memory Stack`. The `Codex Daemon` manages this zone, ensuring memory integrity, retention policies, and providing access for other agents.
*   **Linked Protocols**: Memory Lawyer Protocol, Trust Decay Model, Validation Simulations.

## 4. Workshop (Agent Development & Testing)
*   **Metaphor**: A controlled environment for building, testing, and refining new tools and mechanisms.
*   **Function**: A sandbox for `Validation Simulations` and new `Agent Template` onboarding. Agents can be deployed here in isolation or controlled interaction to test their behavior and adherence to protocols before full deployment.
*   **Linked Protocols**: Agent Template, Validation Simulations.

## 5. Public Square (Interface Layer)
*   **Metaphor**: A central gathering place where citizens interact and information is exchanged openly.
*   **Function**: Represents the user-facing `Interface Layer`, including the `Codex CLI` and any future graphical interfaces. `Copilot` often operates here, assisting users and other agents.
*   **Linked Protocols**: Translator Protocol (for user input/output).

## 6. Watchtower (Monitoring & Logging)
*   **Metaphor**: A vantage point for observing the entire city and detecting anomalies.
*   **Function**: Centralized system for monitoring agent activities, logging events, and performing health checks. It feeds data into the `Trust Decay Model` and provides input for `Artemis`'s governance role.
*   **Linked Scripts**: `networked_scripts/system_health_check.sh`
