# Validation Simulations Protocol

This protocol outlines the framework for conducting simulations to validate agent behavior, memory integrity, and protocol effectiveness within the Agentic Codex.

## Purpose:
*   **Proactive Anomaly Detection**: Identify potential drift or failure modes before they impact live operations.
*   **Memory Integrity Checks**: Simulate scenarios to test the resilience and accuracy of the memory stack.
*   **Protocol Stress Testing**: Evaluate the robustness of communication, governance, and transfer protocols under various conditions.
*   **Agent Training & Refinement**: Provide a controlled environment for agents to learn and adapt without real-world consequences.

## Simulation Types:
1.  **Scenario-Based Simulations**: Pre-defined scenarios designed to test specific agent interactions or system responses.
2.  **Fuzzing Simulations**: Introduce random or malformed inputs to test system resilience and error handling.
3.  **Adversarial Simulations**: Simulate malicious agents or external threats to test security and defense mechanisms.

## Outcomes & Reporting:
*   Detailed logs of simulation runs, including agent actions, memory state changes, and protocol adherence.
*   Identification of vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, or unexpected behaviors.
*   Recommendations for agent recalibration, protocol adjustments, or memory stack improvements.
*   Integration with the Trust Decay Model to update agent and memory trust scores based on simulation performance.
