# Trust Decay Model

> **Purpose:** This document describes the **Trust Decay Model**, a framework for dynamically evaluating the reliability of agents, memories, and protocols. It provides a quantitative mechanism for trust to decrease over time and to be adjusted based on system interactions, which is essential for security and managing agent drift.

This model defines how trust in agents, memories, and protocols erodes or strengthens over time and based on interactions within the Agentic Codex.

## Core Concepts:
*   **Initial Trust Score**: Each agent, memory, or protocol starts with a baseline trust score.
*   **Decay Rate**: Trust naturally decays over time if not reinforced by positive interactions or validations.
*   **Reinforcement Events**: Positive actions (e.g., successful task completion, validation by other trusted agents, adherence to protocols) can increase trust.
*   **Negative Events**: Failures, policy violations, or inconsistencies significantly decrease trust.
*   **Trust Thresholds**: Specific trust scores trigger actions (e.g., re-evaluation by Artemis, restricted access, increased scrutiny).

## Application:
*   **Agent Trust**: Influences an agent's ability to access resources, initiate actions, and be relied upon by other agents.
*   **Memory Trust**: Determines the reliability and weight given to specific memory entries. Low-trust memories may be flagged for re-validation or eventual purging.
*   **Protocol Trust**: Reflects the system's confidence in the effectiveness and security of a given protocol.

## Drift Countermeasures Integration:
The Trust Decay Model is closely linked with agent drift countermeasures, providing a quantitative metric for detecting and responding to deviations from intended behavior.
