# Memory Lawyer Protocol

> **Purpose:** This document defines the **Memory Lawyer Protocol**, a set of rules governing how memory is created, accessed, and disputed within the system. It ensures that all memory operations are fair, transparent, and accountable, acting as a judicial-like framework for data integrity.

This protocol outlines the rules and procedures for managing, accessing, and disputing memory within the Agentic Codex. It acts as the "judicial review" for memory-related concerns.

## Principles:
*   **Attribution**: All memory entries must be attributable to an agent or system event.
*   **Integrity**: Memories must be protected from unauthorized alteration.
*   **Contextual Retention**: Memories are retained based on their relevance and the Trust Decay Model.
*   **Ephemeral vs. Retained**: Clear distinction and rules for temporary vs. persistent memory.

## Key Functions:
1.  **Memory Access Control**: Defines which agents can read, write, or delete specific memory segments.
2.  **Dispute Resolution**: Provides a human-readable log and a process for agents (or humans) to challenge the accuracy or validity of a memory entry.
3.  **Retention Policies**: Specifies rules for how long different types of memories are kept, linking to the Trust Decay Model.
4.  **Auditing & Logging**: Ensures comprehensive logging of all memory interactions for transparency and accountability.
5.  **Memory Tokenization**: Describes how memory tokens or compressed timelines are generated and used for efficient context recall.
