# Agent Template

> **Purpose:** This document provides a standardized template for defining new agents within the Artemis City framework. It ensures that all agents are consistently documented with clear operational parameters, security boundaries, and functional roles.
>
> **Usage:** To create a new agent, copy this template and fill in the specified fields. This process is crucial for maintaining system transparency, security, and accountability.

This template defines the essential characteristics and operational parameters for any new agent integrated into the Agentic Codex.

**Agent Name:** [Unique identifier for the agent, e.g., "Artemis", "Pack Rat"]

**System Access Scope:** [Describe the boundaries of the agent's access to system resources, data, and other agents. E.g., "Read-only access to memory logs", "Write access to specific communication channels", "Full access to Sandbox City simulation parameters"]

**Semantic Role:** [A clear, concise description of the agent's primary function and purpose within the Codex. E.g., "Mayor protocol, governance", "Courier role, safe transfer", "System anchor, memory interface", "Companion, elastic augmentation"]

**Energy Signature:** [Describe the computational or resource footprint of the agent. E.g., "Low-compute, event-driven", "High-compute, continuous monitoring", "Moderate, on-demand processing"]

**Linked Protocols:** [List any specific communication, data handling, or operational protocols the agent adheres to or interacts with. E.g., "Translator Protocol", "Trust Decay Model", "Memory Lawyer Protocol"]

**Drift Countermeasures:** [Mechanisms or strategies in place to prevent or detect deviations from the agent's intended role or behavior. E.g., "Regular self-audits against semantic role", "Anomaly detection on output patterns", "Periodic human review checkpoints"]

**Trust Threshold Triggers:** [Conditions or events that would initiate a review or re-evaluation of the agent's trust level within the system. E.g., "Violation of system access scope", "Failure to adhere to linked protocols", "Consistent deviation from expected energy signature", "Request for elevated privileges"]

**Notes for Implementation:**
*   Ensure all fields are thoroughly documented before agent deployment.
*   Regularly review and update agent definitions as the Codex evolves.
*   Consider the implications of the agent's role on system security and stability.
