# Release Gatecheck Protocol

This protocol defines the essential checklist and criteria that must be met before any public release, significant token usage, or extension of the AI stack for the Agentic Codex. It ensures alignment with internal ethics and operational readiness.

## Categories:

### 1. Ethical & Alignment Review
*   [ ] **Codex Manifesto Adherence**: All new features and agent behaviors align with the core principles.
*   [ ] **Bias Mitigation**: Identified and mitigated potential biases in agent reasoning or data processing.
*   [ ] **Transparency & Explainability**: Mechanisms are in place to explain agent decisions and system behavior.
*   [ ] **Human Oversight**: Clear human-in-the-loop points for critical decisions or error correction.

### 2. Security & Resilience
*   [ ] **Vulnerability Assessment**: Comprehensive security audit completed (e.g., penetration testing, code review).
*   [ ] **Drift Countermeasures**: All agents have robust drift detection and correction mechanisms.
*   [ ] **Memory Integrity**: Memory stack resilience tested against corruption and unauthorized access.
*   [ ] **Redundancy & Failover**: Critical components have redundancy and failover strategies.

### 3. Performance & Scalability
*   [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: System meets defined performance KPIs under load.
*   [ ] **Resource Optimization**: Agents and protocols are optimized for efficient resource utilization (energy signature).
*   [ ] **Scalability Testing**: System can scale to anticipated user/agent load.

### 4. Documentation & Usability
*   [ ] **Comprehensive Documentation**: All agents, protocols, and interfaces are fully documented.
*   [ ] **User Guides**: Clear guides for human interaction and administration (e.g., updated `README.md`).
*   [ ] **Onboarding Process**: New agent onboarding (`agent_template.md`) is clear and functional.

### 5. Legal & Licensing
*   [ ] **Open Source Covenant**: Adherence to the `open_source_covenant.md` for public components.
*   [ ] **Third-Party Licenses**: All third-party dependencies' licenses are compatible and documented.
*   [ ] **Data Privacy**: Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations.
