# Codex Manifesto

## Purpose & Principles
This Codex exists to align agentic reasoning with transparent, accountable action. It balances trust, entropy, and collaboration across distributed intelligence systemsâ€”both human and machine.

### Core Tenets:
*   **Iterative Clarity, Not Static Truth**: The Codex is a living document, evolving with understanding and experience.
*   **Net Good Over Noise**: Prioritize actions and information that contribute positively to the system's goals and ethical boundaries.
*   **Transparent Accountability**: Every agent's actions and decisions are auditable and attributable.
*   **Collaborative Autonomy**: Agents operate with defined autonomy within a collaborative framework.
*   **Resilience through Entropy Management**: Acknowledge and manage the natural decay and drift within complex systems.
